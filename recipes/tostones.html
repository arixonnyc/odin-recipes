    <h1>Tostones</h1>
    <p>Plantain slices, fried and smashed, served crispy and salty. Nothing is as easy and mouth-watering! Tostones (sometimes referred to merely as fritos) are extremely versatile: they can be served as a side or eaten alone, just like fries; dipped in sauce for a quick bite; made for breakfast, lunch or dinner, or a snack at any hour.</p>
